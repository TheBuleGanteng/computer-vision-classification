# GPU Proxy Integration Status Report

**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Project**: Computer Vision Classification - GPU Proxy Integration  
**Status**: **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - RUNPOD RESPONSE SIZE LIMIT**

## Executive Summary

The GPU proxy integration has made **significant progress** with the root cause of the issue now identified. The system successfully:
- ✅ Establishes communication with RunPod API
- ✅ Submits jobs and receives completion status
- ✅ Executes code remotely on GPU workers
- ✅ Generates complete training results in handler
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: RunPod API rejects responses due to size limits

**Current Status**: **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** - RunPod's synchronous API has response size limits (~18KB) and rejects handler responses with HTTP 400 Bad Request, causing only metadata to be returned to client.
